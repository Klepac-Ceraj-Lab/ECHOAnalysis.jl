# Metadata Analysis

## Getting Data

Now that we have the metadata in long form,
it's a bit easier to query it for the stuff we want.
I'm using the macros available from the [DataFramesMeta](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFramesMeta.jl) package.

```julia
ENV["GKSwstype"] = "100"
using ECHOAnalysis
using DataFrames
using DataFramesMeta
using StatsPlots

allmeta = load_metadata(datatoml);
```

As an example, how many unique subjects do we have at least one sample for?

```julia
@linq allmeta |>
    select(:studyID) |>
    unique |> nrow
```

Or, how many subjects have two or more fecal samples?

```julia
sampleinfo = @linq allmeta |>
    where(:metadatum .== "CollectionRep") |>
    by(:studyID, nsamples = length(:studyID))


histogram(sampleinfo[:nsamples], legend=false,
    title="Samples per Subject ID",
    xlabel="# of fecal samples", ylabel="# of subjects")
```

```julia
# make directory if it doesn't exist
isdir(datatoml["figures"]["path"]) || mkdir(datatoml["figures"]["path"])
savefig(joinpath(datatoml["figures"]["path"], "03-samples-per-subject.png"))
```

Wow - there are a couple of subjects that have a lot of samples.
Taking a look to see what's going on there:

```julia
# Which subjects are those?
highsamplers = @linq allmeta |>
    where(:metadatum .== "CollectionRep") |>
    by(:studyID, nsamples = length(:studyID)) |>
    where(:nsamples .>= 5) |>
    select(:studyID, :nsamples)

randrows(highsamplers)
```

## Metagenomes

At this stage, what I care about are samples with metagenomes,
which are inidcated by the `DOM` metadatum.
To find all of the studyID/timepoint combos that have that have metagenomes:

```julia
# filter on metagenomes (DOM = "Date of Metagenome")
highsamplers = @linq filter(r-> r[:studyID] in highsamplers[:studyID], allmeta) |>
    where(:metadatum .== "DOM") |>
    orderby(:studyID, :timepoint)

first(highsamplers, 15) |> randrows
```

So a bunch of these are where
multiple samples were given for the same timepoint (eg `C0202_4F_1A` and `_2A`)
and/or both genotech and enthanol samples.

```julia
mgxsamples = @linq allmeta |>
    where(:metadatum .== "DOM") |>
    select(:studyID, :timepoint) |>
    unique

sort!(mgxsamples, :studyID);
first(mgxsamples, 5) |> randrows
```

And we can get metadata for these samples using the [`getfocusmetadata`](@ref) function,
which converts the longform data into a wide table with one row per subject/timepoint pair.
Metadata from "timpoint 0" (that is, non time-dependent data) is added to every row for
that subject.

```julia
samples = map(row-> (subject=row[:studyID], timepoint=row[:timepoint]), eachrow(mgxsamples))
focus = getfocusmetadata(allmeta, samples)
sort!(focus, [:subject, :timepoint])
focus[rand(nrow(focus)) .< 10 / nrow(focus), :]
```
